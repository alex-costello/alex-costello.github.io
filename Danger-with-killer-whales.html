                        <h2>Can 'Killer whales' kill?</h2>

                                           <p>Due to popular belief most people have the general consensus that Orcas if in contact with humans, will eat you and try to kill you. This is simply nnot true. Killer whales unlike their defining name have had almost no attacks in the past 100 years that have ended a life. the only attacks that have occurred are ones that many marine animal experts have deemed as 'playful' behaviours rather than vengeful. Although it is a cliche, these animals can be very misunderstood. The hard parts of spreading information with this animal is that when you hear the name 'killer whale' it often already makes people a tad frightened or wary of them. Orcas under certain situatons can be very calm and playful with humans or keepers they are comfortable with. When someone who encounters an orca who does not have a relationship with the animal, the whales can freak out or the person who is with them can start to panic which leads to an almost endless cycle of panic and anxiety. Sometimes understanding these 'scary' animals can help us to view certain events in a different light and with a different approach.
