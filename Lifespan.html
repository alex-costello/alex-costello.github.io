                                           <p>Orcas usually have the lifespan from 35-40 years, although some grow to be much older. For example a killer whale by the name of "Granny" who unfortunetely died in 2016 was assumed to be between the ages of 60 and 100. These whales usually live longer in captivity due to the way they tend to orcas and their health. after they are kept in captivity for most of their life it is almost impossible for them to fend for themselves in the wild so by the time they are ready to be released or old enough to be on their own, they are too comfortable and used to the care around then at either zoos, wildlife centres or in other facilities. The process of captivity makes it increasingly harder for them to hunt in the wild as well.
