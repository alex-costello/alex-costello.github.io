                                           <p>Orcas or better known as killer whales have a distinct black and white colour. Their bellies are white and their backs are black. Orcas have a lot of similarities in terms of bodily structure with dolphins. Dolphins and killer whales are in the same family as well as many other aquatic animals. When spotted from above the water, they also amy appear as sharks. this is because of their large and dark coloured dorsal fin. in some of orcas their dorsal fin can collapse due to injury, weakness in their fins, or even oil spills. for example, a famous orca with a collapsed and almost circular seeming dorsal fin is the 'killer whale' who plays 'Willy' in the heartwarming children's movie 'Free Willy'.
